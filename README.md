## 🔖&nbsp; About

The Counter is small a project created in a Roger Melo's JS (CJRM) Course to criate a counter using Bootstrap to layout and JS to add actions to the buttons. The start button makes the counter start, the stop button makes the counter stop and the reset button makes the counter reset. It is a project created in order to put into practice part of the course content as *setInterval() and clearInterval()* functions.
